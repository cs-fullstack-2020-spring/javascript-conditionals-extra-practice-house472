```
### Problem 2:
Ask the user to enter a number. If the number is between -5 and 5 print 
```
[NUMBER] is between -5 and 5.
```
Oherwise print
```
[NUMBER] is not between -5 and 5.
```
### Problem 3:
Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 12. Print the corresponding month of the year. If they do not input a number between 1 and 12 print "That is not a day month of the year."

10 = Oct
11 = Nov

```
### Problem 4:
Ask the user to enter a number. Ask the user to enter another number. If the diffrence of those two numbers is divisible by 3 alert the user 
```
The sum of [FIRST NUMBER] and [SECOND NUMBER] is divisible by three.
```
Oherwise alert the user
```
The sum of [FIRST NUMBER] and [SECOND NUMBER] is not divisible by three.
```
### Problem 5:
Define a variable called `secretNumber` with the value 10. Ask the user to enter a number. Ask the user to enter another number. If the sum of the numbers is greater than the value of `secretNumber` and neither number is equal to the value of `secretNumber`
```
Your sum is greater than our secret number but our number is still secret!
```
If the sum of the numbers is greater than the value of `secretNumber` and at least one of the numbers is equal to `secretnumber` print
```
Your guessed our secret number!
```
If the sum of the numbers is less than the value of `secretNumber` print
```
Your sum is too low!
```
### Problem 6:

```
The sum of [NUMBER ONE] and [NUMBER TWO] is 20 or greater
```
Otherwise print
```
The sum of [NUMBER ONE] and [NUMBER TWO] is [DIFFRENCE]
```
### Problem 8:
Delcare a varibale called `returningUser` with the value of your name. Declare a variable called `num` with the value 25. Ask the user to guess a number. Ask the user to enter their name. If the user guesses a number greater the value of `num` BUT their name doesn't match the value of `returningUser` print
```
[NUMBER] is greater than our number but you are the wrong user
```
If the user guesses a number less than the value of `num` BUT their name does match the value of `returningUser` print
```
[NUMBER] is less than our number but you are the right user
```
If the user guesses the correct number AND their name does match the value of `returningUser` print
```
[NUMBER] is greater than our number and you are the right user
```
### Problem 9:
Ask the user to enter their name. If the user enters "Autumn", "Kenn", or "Kevin" print
```
You are a teacher
```
If the user enters "Erin" or "Meka" print
